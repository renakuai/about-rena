<h2>Welcome to my Github!</h2>
Hi! I'm an end-to-end Product Designer who is passionate about bridging the gap between design and code and creating experiences that make a positive impact on people. I love learning and making stuff, which has recently led me down the path of diving deep into the world of Front-End coding and *potentially* becoming a design technologist or UX Engineer.
